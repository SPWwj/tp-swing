## **Design**

### Architecture

<puml src="diagrams/ArchitectureDiagram.puml" width="280" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** (consisting of classes [`Main`](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-W13-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-W13-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java)) is in charge of the app launch and shut down.
* At app launch, it initializes the other components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down, it shuts down the other components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

The bulk of the app's work is done by the following four components:

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

<puml src="diagrams/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.puml" width="574" />

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<puml src="diagrams/ComponentManagers.puml" width="300" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI component

The **API** of this component is specified in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-W13-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java)

<puml src="diagrams/UiClassDiagram.puml" alt="Structure of the UI Component"/>

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-W13-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-W13-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
* keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `Student` object residing in the `Model`.

### Logic component

**API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-W13-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<puml src="diagrams/LogicClassDiagram.puml" width="550"/>

The sequence diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component, taking `execute("delete 1")` API call as an example.

<puml src="diagrams/DeleteSequenceDiagram.puml" alt="Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command" />

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
</box>

How the `Logic` component works:

1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it is passed to an `AddressBookParser` object which in turn creates a parser that matches the command (e.g., `DeleteCommandParser`) and uses it to parse the command.
1. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `DeleteCommand`) which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to delete a student).
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned back from `Logic`.

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<puml src="diagrams/ParserClasses.puml" width="600"/>

How the parsing works:
* When called upon to parse a user command, the `AddressBookParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `AddCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to parse the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `AddCommand`) which the `AddressBookParser` returns back as a `Command` object.
* All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `AddCommandParser`, `DeleteCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser` interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.

### Model component
**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-W13-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

<puml src="diagrams/ModelClassDiagram.puml" width="450" />


The `Model` component,

* stores the address book data i.e., all `Student` objects (which are contained in a `UniquePersonList` object).
* stores the currently 'selected' `Student` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate _filtered_ list which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Student>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the userâ€™s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as a `ReadOnlyUserPref` objects.
* does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, they should make sense on their own without depending on other components)

<box type="info" seamless>

[//]: # (**Note:** An alternative &#40;arguably, a more OOP&#41; model is given below. It has a `Subject` list in the `AddressBook`, which `Student` references. This allows `AddressBook` to only require one `Subject` object per unique subject, instead of each `Student` needing their own `Subject` objects.<br>)

<puml src="diagrams/BetterModelClassDiagram.puml" width="450" />

</box>


### Storage component

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-W13-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

<puml src="diagrams/StorageClassDiagram.puml" width="550" />

The `Storage` component,
* can save both address book data and user preference data in JSON format, and read them back into corresponding objects.
* inherits from both `AddressBookStorage` and `UserPrefStorage`, which means it can be treated as either one (if only the functionality of only one is needed).
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects that belong to the `Model`)

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.addressbook.commons` package.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

### Filter feature

#### Implementation

The `filter` command allows the user to display a list of students who fulfil all predicates specified within the command.

When the user enters a filter command, the `AddressBookParser` parses the user's input and returns a `FilterCommand`.

Each predicate entered by the user can be modelled by exactly one of the following classes: `StudentHasAddressPredicate`, `StudentHasEmailPredicate`, `StudentHasPhonePredicate`, `StudentIsGenderPredicate`, `StudentIsSecLevelPredicate`, `StudentNearestMrtIsPredicate` and `StudentTakesSubjectPredicate`. These predicates can be added to the `predicateList` field of type `StudentPredicateList` within each `FilterCommand` object.

The following sequence diagram shows how the `filter` command works. In this example, the user is executing the following command: `filter s/Physics g/M`.

<puml src="diagrams/FilterSequenceDiagram.puml" alt="FilterSequenceDiagram" />

When the `FilterCommandParser` parses the arguments to the `FilterCommand`, it creates a `StudentPredicateList`, to which the relevant predicates specified within the command are added. For example, using the example command given above, the `StudentPredicateList` would consist of 2 predicates: a `StudentTakesSubjectPredicate` and a `StudentIsGenderPredicate`.
These predicates are then combined into a single `Predicate<Student>`, using the `and()` method from the `Predicate` interface.

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a `filter` command:

<puml src="diagrams/FilterActivityDiagram.puml" alt="FilterActivityDiagram" width="250" />

#### Design considerations:

**Aspect: How the predicates specified within a single `FilterCommand` should be combined:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Combine predicates using the `and()` method from the `Predicate` interface.
  * Pros:
    * More in line with what the user would expect from a `filter` command.
  * Cons:
    * Users would experience less flexibility when using the command (for instance, the command `filter s/Physics s/Chemistry` cannot be used to display students taking Physics and/or Chemistry at the tuition centre).
* Alternative 2: Combine predicates using the `or()` method from the `Predicate` interface.
  * Pros:
    * Greater flexibility for users when filtering the list of students.
  * Cons:
    * Less in line with users' expectations of a `filter` command; not as intuitive.
* We made the choice of Alternative 1 over Alternative 2 as we found that more intuitive commands would be easier for users to learn and eventually master.

### Sort feature

#### Implementation

The `sort` command allows the user to sort the list of students in alphabetical order to enhance efficiency in searching.

When the user enters a sort command, the `AddressBookParser` parses the user's input and returns a `SortCommand`.

The predicate entered by the user can be modelled by the following class: `SortIn`.

The following sequence diagram shows how the `sort` command works. In this example, the user is executing the following command: `sort in/ASC`.

<puml src="diagrams/SortSequenceDiagram.puml" alt="FilterSequenceDiagram" />

When the `SortCommandParser` parses the argument to the `SortCommand`, the argument is stored as an attribute of type SortIn in `SortCommand`.
This predicate is then passed into the current model, using the `updateSortedPersonList()` method.

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a `sort` command:

<puml src="diagrams/FilterActivityDiagram.puml" alt="SortActivityDiagram" width="250" />

#### Design considerations:

**Aspect: How the student list is sorted internally:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Sort the student list in class `UniquePersonList` using method `sort`.
    * Pros:
        * Student list is sorted permanently, ensuring no repeated sorting needed in the next launch provided no new student is added or student's name is changed.
        * Enhance efficiency of looking through the student list, ensure no repeated sorting needed when doing consecutive commands such as `filter`.
    * Cons:
        * Users would be unable to view the unsorted student list again.
* Alternative 2: Sort the student list in class `ModelManager` using method `updateSortedPersonList`.
    * Pros:
        * Enable users to view the unsorted student list for every launch.
    * Cons:
        * Users have to resort the student list for every launch. 
* We made the choice of Alternative 1 over Alternative 2 as we insist on providing greater convenience.

### Import feature

#### Implementation

The `import` command allows the user to import .csv files containing their students' data in one go so that they do not need to add them one-by-one.

When the user enters a import command, the `AddressBookParser` parses the user's input using `ImportCommandParser` and returns a `ImportCommand`.

The following sequence diagram shows how the `import` command works. In this example, the user is executing the following command: `import student_data.csv`.

<puml src="diagrams/ImportSequenceDiagram.puml" alt="ImportSequenceDiagram" />

When the `ImportCommandParser` parses the arguments, it creates a list of `Student` objects using the data in the .csv file and passes the argument and the list into the `ImportCommand`. `ImportCommand` will then add the `Student` into the `AddressBook`.

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a `import` command:

<puml src="diagrams/ImportActivityDiagram.puml" alt="ImportActivityDiagram" width="250" />

#### Design considerations:

**Aspect: How to separate the attributes correctly from the imported data**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Fixed column sequence for data in the imported .csv files.
    * Pros:
        * Students' data with comma such as address can be detected more easily and will not be split wrongly.
    * Cons:
        * Users would experience less flexibility when using the command (for instance, users need to ensure their column in their .csv files matches the sequence).
* Alternative 2: Flexible column sequence for data in the imported .csv files.
    * Pros:
        * Greater flexibility for users when importing students'data.
    * Cons:
        * Higher chance in wrong a splitting of students' data.
* We made the choice of Alternative 1 over Alternative 2 as we found that a fixed format would be easier for users to remember and use in the .csv files.


### Table feature

#### Implementation
The `table` command allows users to generate a statistical table either categorised by `gender`, `subject` or `sec-level`

When the user enters a table command, the `AddressBookParser` parses the user's input and return a `TableCommand`.

Note that there is no specifically a TableCommandParser for `TableCommand` just like `ListCommand`, `ExitCommand` and `HelpCommand`. The `AddressBookParser` can parse and return a `TableCommand`directly.

The parameters entered by user expected for a table command are either `g/`, `s/` and `l/`. When the `TableCommand` instance created by `AddressBookParser` executes, it will return the corresponding CommamdResult. E.g. `GenderTableCommandResult` created for the case `table g/` is entered by user. This `XXXTableCommandResult` carries the counts for each category that will be used for generating the table. 

The following sequence diagram shows how the `table` command works. In this example, the user is executing the following command: `table s/`

<puml src="diagrams/TableSequenceDiagram.puml" alt="TableSequenceDiagram" />

As shown in the sequence diagram, when the `AddressBookParser` parses the arguments to the TableCommand, it creates a TableCommand instance by passing in `s/` as argument so that when this `TableCommand` execute, it will return a `SubjectTableCommandResult` instance as specified by `s/`.

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a `table` command:

<puml src="diagrams/TableActivityDiagram.puml" alt="TableActivityDiagram" width="250" />

#### Design considerations:

**Aspect: How to parse the argument for table internally:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** parse inside `TableCommand` and return the corresponding `XXXTableCommandResult`.
    * Pros: Easy to implement, more straightforward when the number of possible arguments is less.
    * Cons: May not be suitable when we want to create a complex statistical table, e.g. a two dimensional table.

* **Alternative 2:** Create a CommandParser specifically for TableCommand.
    * Pros: Provides a good abstraction when we are dealing with two dimensional table.
    * Cons: May be reduntant when we only want to create one dimensional table and the number of possible category is less.

* We made the choice of Alternative 1 over Alternative 2 as we found that the table we intend to create so far is one dimensional table and there are only three possible categories, that are , `g/` for gender, `s/` for subject and `l/` for sec-level.
_{more aspects and alternatives to be added}_


### \[Proposed\] Undo/redo feature

#### Proposed Implementation

The proposed undo/redo mechanism is facilitated by `VersionedAddressBook`. It extends `AddressBook` with an undo/redo history, stored internally as an `addressBookStateList` and `currentStatePointer`. Additionally, it implements the following operations:

* `VersionedAddressBook#commit()`â€‰â€”â€‰Saves the current address book state in its history.
* `VersionedAddressBook#undo()`â€‰â€”â€‰Restores the previous address book state from its history.
* `VersionedAddressBook#redo()`â€‰â€”â€‰Restores a previously undone address book state from its history.

These operations are exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#commitAddressBook()`, `Model#undoAddressBook()` and `Model#redoAddressBook()` respectively.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the undo/redo mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The `VersionedAddressBook` will be initialized with the initial address book state, and the `currentStatePointer` pointing to that single address book state.

<puml src="diagrams/UndoRedoState0.puml" alt="UndoRedoState0" />

Step 2. The user executes `delete 5` command to delete the 5th student in the address book. The `delete` command calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`, causing the modified state of the address book after the `delete 5` command executes to be saved in the `addressBookStateList`, and the `currentStatePointer` is shifted to the newly inserted address book state.

<puml src="diagrams/UndoRedoState1.puml" alt="UndoRedoState1" />

Step 3. The user executes `add n/David â€¦â€‹` to add a new student. The `add` command also calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`, causing another modified address book state to be saved into the `addressBookStateList`.

<puml src="diagrams/UndoRedoState2.puml" alt="UndoRedoState2" />

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** If a command fails its execution, it will not call `Model#commitAddressBook()`, so the address book state will not be saved into the `addressBookStateList`.

</box>

Step 4. The user now decides that adding the student was a mistake, and decides to undo that action by executing the `undo` command. The `undo` command will call `Model#undoAddressBook()`, which will shift the `currentStatePointer` once to the left, pointing it to the previous address book state, and restores the address book to that state.

<puml src="diagrams/UndoRedoState3.puml" alt="UndoRedoState3" />


<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** If the `currentStatePointer` is at index 0, pointing to the initial AddressBook state, then there are no previous AddressBook states to restore. The `undo` command uses `Model#canUndoAddressBook()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather
than attempting to perform the undo.

</box>

The following sequence diagram shows how the undo operation works:

<puml src="diagrams/UndoSequenceDiagram.puml" alt="UndoSequenceDiagram" />

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** The lifeline for `UndoCommand` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

</box>

The `redo` command does the oppositeâ€‰â€”â€‰it calls `Model#redoAddressBook()`, which shifts the `currentStatePointer` once to the right, pointing to the previously undone state, and restores the address book to that state.

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** If the `currentStatePointer` is at index `addressBookStateList.size() - 1`, pointing to the latest address book state, then there are no undone AddressBook states to restore. The `redo` command uses `Model#canRedoAddressBook()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the redo.

</box>

Step 5. The user then decides to execute the command `list`. Commands that do not modify the address book, such as `list`, will usually not call `Model#commitAddressBook()`, `Model#undoAddressBook()` or `Model#redoAddressBook()`. Thus, the `addressBookStateList` remains unchanged.

<puml src="diagrams/UndoRedoState4.puml" alt="UndoRedoState4" />

Step 6. The user executes `clear`, which calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`. Since the `currentStatePointer` is not pointing at the end of the `addressBookStateList`, all address book states after the `currentStatePointer` will be purged. Reason: It no longer makes sense to redo the `add n/David â€¦â€‹` command. This is the behavior that most modern desktop applications follow.

<puml src="diagrams/UndoRedoState5.puml" alt="UndoRedoState5" />

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new command:

<puml src="diagrams/CommitActivityDiagram.puml" width="250" />

#### Design considerations:

**Aspect: How undo & redo executes:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Saves the entire address book.
  * Pros: Easy to implement.
  * Cons: May have performance issues in terms of memory usage.

* **Alternative 2:** Individual command knows how to undo/redo by
  itself.
  * Pros: Will use less memory (e.g. for `delete`, just save the student being deleted).
  * Cons: We must ensure that the implementation of each individual command are correct.
